## Klinsy - The Recurring Tasks Manager (v1.0.0+3)

Klinsy is a recurring tasks manager. It helps people of all kind which have challenges in keeping things done that are recurring by their nature, for instance, emptying their trash bin, cleaning up the mess after a meal, or at least remind them to prepare and have a meal at all.

The idea for this project came up, when I discussed the challenges I have as an autistic person with my social worker.

This project is open source and MIT-licenced, we welcome any contributions.
